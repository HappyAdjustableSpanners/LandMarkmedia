    <h1>GDPR</h1>
    <hr class="hr-short-red">
    <p class="margin-bottom-50 margin-top-50">In April 2016 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted across all countries
within the European Union. In May 2018, the regulation becomes enforceable with fines up to 4%
of annual worldwide turnover if an infringement of the regulation is found to have happened.
Because of this, it is imperative that all companies that retain and use individual personal data from
their customers are compliant with this directive.

In a recent survey, only 28% of companies were currently compliant with the GDPR rules that
come into full effect later this year. Landmark Media are therefore able to provide the following
GDPR services:</p>
