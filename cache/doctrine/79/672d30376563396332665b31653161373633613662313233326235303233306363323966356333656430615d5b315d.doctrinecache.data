                        <p>One of the main pain points in the media planning and buying process is ensuring that the right
contractual terms are in place between all parties involved: advertiser and media agency, media
agency and media owner and, in some cases where the agency relationship does not exist (such
as in-housed media planning and buying) between advertiser and media owners. In addition to
this, the topic of transparency has been a major industry subject over the last few years. In order
to reduce these pain points, Landmark Media provide the following services:
Transparency audit. How transparent is your current media agency contract? How could this be
improved?

                        <h3><a href="">GDPR</a></h3>

                        <p>In April 2016 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted across all countries
within the European Union. In May 2018, the regulation becomes enforceable with fines up to 4%
of annual worldwide turnover if an infringement of the regulation is found to have happened.
Because of this, it is imperative that all companies that retain and use individual personal data from
their customers are compliant with this directive.
In a recent survey, only 28% of companies were currently compliant with the GDPR rules that
come into full effect later this year. Landmark Media are therefore able to provide the following
GDPR services:
- Fire testing current company GDPR compliance processes
- Advice and guidance on the implementation of the GDPR requirements
- Development and implementation of company GDPR processes and practices if currently not in
place
- Outsourcing the role of Data Protection Officer (DPO) to ensure full compliance, training and
development, engagement with the Information Commissioner’s Officer (ICO)</p>

                        <h3><a href="">Inhousing Media Planning and Buying</a></h3>

                        <p>In the last few years there has been a trend by advertisers to start in-housing some or all of their
media planning buying capabilities. SEO/PPC, programmatic digital campaigns and social media
planning and buying are often considered easy to in-house: hire additional staff and license inhouse
marcoms technology and the cost saving outweighs the perceived challenges of having to
deal with a media agency. However, what is often over looked is the separation of online and
offline media can result in a reduction in conversions or brand awareness making the overall
marketing significantly less effective, keeping the staff up-to-date with new opportunities,
technological developments or strategic opportunities is lost as this is the traditional skillset of
media agencies, and having to develop relationships with a significant number of media owners is
extremely difficult and, again, managed expertly by most media agencies on advertiser’s behalf.
Therefore, to manage this process, Landmark Media can provide the following services:
- Development of the full criteria list to establish as to whether in-housing is or is not the right
strategic move for you as an advertiser
- If in-housing is the right option, then: 
 - auditing and selection process of the right inhousing technology, processes and system
integrations
 - comprehensive data strategy to ensure that you have the right data, are compliant with all
the legal requirements of owning and handling customer data
 - HR/talent liaison to develop job descriptions, selection process, hiring and on-boarding of
new staff into the team
 - ongoing assessment and support of
 - negotiation and trading support to ensure that you develop the right relationships with the
right media owners and technology suppliers</p>
