    <p class="margin-bottom-50 margin-top-50">In the last few years there has been a trend by advertisers to start in-housing some or all of their
media planning buying capabilities. SEO/PPC, programmatic digital campaigns and social media

planning and buying are often considered easy to in-house: hire additional staff and license in-

offline media can result in a reduction in conversions or brand awareness making the overall
marketing significantly less effective, keeping the staff up-to-date with new opportunities,
technological developments or strategic opportunities is lost as this is the traditional skillset of

extremely difficult and, again, managed expertly by most media agencies on advertiserâ€™s behalf.
Therefore, to manage this process, Landmark Media can provide the following services:</p>
