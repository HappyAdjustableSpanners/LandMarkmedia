                        <p>One of the main pain points in the media planning and buying process is ensuring that the right contractual terms are in place between all parties involved: advertiser and media agency, media agency and media owner and, in some cases where the agency relationship does not exist (such as in-housed media planning and buying) between advertiser and media owners.    In addition to this, the topic of transparency has been a  major industry subject over the last few years.   In order to reduce these pain points, Landmark Media provide the following services:</p>

                        <p>In April 2016 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted across all countries within the European Union.  In May 2018, the regulation becomes enforceable with fines up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover if an infringement of the regulation is found to have happened.   Because of this, it is imperative that all companies that retain and use individual personal data from their customers are compliant with this directive.

In a recent survey, only 28% of companies were currently compliant with the GDPR rules that come into full effect later this year.   Landmark Media are therefore able to provide the following GDPR services:</p>

                        <p>In the last few years there has been a trend by advertisers to start in-housing some or all of their media planning buying capabilities.   SEO/PPC, programmatic digital campaigns and social media planning and buying are often considered easy to in-house: hire additional staff and license inhouse marcoms technology and the cost saving outweighs the perceived challenges of having to deal with a media agency.    However, what is often over looked is the separation of online and offline media can result in a reduction in conversions or brand awareness making the overall marketing significantly less effective, keeping the staff up-to-date with new opportunities, technological developments or strategic opportunities is lost as this is the traditional skillset of media agencies, and having to develop relationships with a significant number of media owners is extremely difficult and, again, managed expertly by most media agencies on advertiser’s behalf.   
Therefore, to manage this process, Landmark Media can provide the following services: - Development of the full criteria list to establish as to whether in-housing is or is not the right strategic move for you as an advertiser - If in-housing is the right option, then:</p>
